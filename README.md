# TheSpaceShootingGame

A Unity-based arcade-style asteroid game inspired by the classic Asteroids game.

Unlike the original, this version does not split asteroids when destroyed. Instead, the game increases difficulty over time by adding a new asteroid every 20 seconds.

Features

Classic Space Shooter Gameplay: Control a spaceship and shoot asteroids.

Dynamic Difficulty: Every 20 seconds, a new asteroid is added to the play area, making survival progressively harder.

Simple Controls:

Arrow Keys / WASD: Move your spaceship

Spacebar / Fire Button: Shoot bullets

Score System: Track your performance based on how long you survive and how many asteroids you destroy.

How to Play

Launch the game in Unity or build it to your preferred platform.

Use movement controls to navigate your spaceship.

Destroy asteroids to survive as long as possible.

Every 20 seconds, an additional asteroid is spawned to increase the challenge.


Notes

Asteroids do not split upon destruction. This change emphasizes survival and strategic shooting.

Difficulty increases over time rather than through asteroid splitting.
